# FinanceRiskAnalytics

## Overview
This repository provides a structured analysis and predictive modeling project focusing on two major financial concerns: **Loan Default Risk Prediction** and **Natural Gas Storage Pricing**. By leveraging machine learning and statistical analysis, we uncover insights that are critical for financial risk assessment and commodity trading strategies.

## Project Structure
- **Loan Default Risk Analysis**: Analysis of borrower characteristics to predict loan default risks.
- **Natural Gas Storage Pricing Analysis**: Seasonal analysis and forecasting of natural gas prices to optimize storage contracts.

## Data
- **Loan Default Dataset**: Contains borrower information like FICO scores, loan terms, interest rates, and default status.
- **Natural Gas Pricing Dataset**: Historical pricing data for natural gas, capturing seasonal and economic fluctuations.

## Repository Structure
- `LoanDefaultRiskAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook analyzing and predicting loan default risks using logistic regression and ensemble models.
- `CommodityStorageContractAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for analyzing natural gas storage pricing and applying time-series models.
- `data/Loan_Data.csv`: CSV file with loan and borrower data for default risk analysis.
- `data/Nat_Gas.csv`: CSV file containing historical natural gas pricing data.

## Requirements
To install the necessary packages, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> **Note:** Recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Key Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation.
- **statsmodels**: Statistical modeling, including time series analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Notebooks and Key Analysis
### 1. Loan Default Risk Analysis
- **Objective**: Predict loan default risks based on borrower data.
- **Methodology**:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes borrower attributes with visualizations and summary statistics.
    - **Logistic Regression & Random Forest**: Predicts the likelihood of default with performance metrics like ROC-AUC.
- **Sample Code**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score
    
    # Data preparation
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
    
    # Model training
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluation
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    print("ROC-AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]))
    ```

### 2. Natural Gas Storage Pricing Analysis
- **Objective**: Forecast natural gas prices to optimize storage strategy.
- **Methodology**:
    - **Time Series Decomposition**: Identifies seasonal, trend, and residual components.
    - **ARIMA Modeling**: Forecasts future prices to inform contract decisions.
- **Sample Code**:
    ```python
    from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Fit ARIMA model
    model = ARIMA(data['price'], order=(1,1,1))
    model_fit = model.fit()
    
    # Forecasting
    forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)
    plt.plot(data.index, data['price'], label='Actual')
    plt.plot(forecast.index, forecast, label='Forecast')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
    ```

## Results
### Loan Default Prediction
- High-risk borrowers were identified through features such as low FICO scores and extended loan terms.
- Model evaluation showed that Random Forest models offered robust predictive accuracy.

### Natural Gas Storage Pricing
- Clear seasonal trends were observed, with price peaks during winter months.
- Forecasting models suggested optimal storage times for minimizing costs and maximizing contract value.
